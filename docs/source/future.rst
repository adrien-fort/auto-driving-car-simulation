| Below is a list of improvements that could be made but weren't in the initial requirements:
|    -Car could stop themselves before entering a collision
|    -Fields could be improved to include forbidden areas/coordinates (tree/wall/etc...)
|    -Car/Vehicules could be given more commands (idle/parked/U turn) and diagonal directions (NE, NW, etc...)
