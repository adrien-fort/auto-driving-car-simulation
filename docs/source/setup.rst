Setup Module
=================

The `setup` module provides a script for configuring logging in the Auto Driving Car Simulation. This is currently a very basic functionality but this module could be used later on for other technical functionalities (OpenTelemetry, API, ...).

Functions
---------------------

.. function:: configure_logging

   Configures logging for the simulation.

Usage
----------

To use the `configure_logging` function, import it into your script:

.. code-block:: python

    from src.setup import configure_logging

    # Example usage
    configure_logging()

    # Rest of your script here
